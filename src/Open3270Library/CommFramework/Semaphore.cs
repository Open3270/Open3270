	/// The Dijkstra semaphore (also called a counting
	/// semaphore) is used to control access to
	/// a set of resources. A Dijkstra semaphore
	/// has a count associated with it and each
	/// Acquire() call reduces the count. A thread
	/// that tries to Acquire() the semaphore
	/// with a zero count blocks until someone else
	/// calls Release() to increase the count.
